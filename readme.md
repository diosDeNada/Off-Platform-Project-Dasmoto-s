Gracias por ayudarme con el Code Review.
Thanks for help me with the Code Review.

I added some extra things to the ones requested in the project, like a nav bar and more products.
The products appear as a link, but do not lead anywhere, it plays an aesthetic role at this time.
The location of the map is to an unknown place in the sea. I suggest not trying to get there :)

I appreciate any feedback you can give me to improve this project, however, I have tried to focus on the semantics and organization of the elements, so it would help me if you pay more attention to those aspects.
Although I know/remember a bit of responsiveness, I didn't apply it to this paper to focus on what I've learned so far in CodeCademy's FrontEnd Engineer Path; This implies that on screens other than laptops or desktop computers, the rearrangement of the images can cause problems.
I know this can be fixed with Flex box or Grid, but like responsiveness, at this point I want to wait further down the Path to include these features.

I have 12% of the path completed. I'm in 50% of the Developing Websites Locally section.

Again, thank you very much for your time and effort.
